### Instructions
The d6files directory includes the d6 format for all polygonal and balanced digraphs up to order 8. The C++ source for the balanced digraphs is included in the C++ directory, while the C++ source code for the polygonal digraphs is located at (https://github.com/trcameron/polygonal-digraphs).

The csvfiles directory includes all distinct (alpha,alpha_comp) values along with the digraphs that attain those values.

The pdffiles directory includes all figures from the paper "On the Laplacian Spread of Digraphs", which is created from the files in the TeX directory. 

The Python directory includes scripts for viewing all possible (alpha,alpha_comp) values as well as the digraphs that attains those values. See the Makefile commands display_values and display_digraphs to run these scripts.
